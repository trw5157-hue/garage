# PWA Logo Files Needed

You need to create two logo files:
1. logo192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. logo512.png (512x512 pixels)

These should be the ICD Tuning logo on a transparent or solid background.

For now, I've created placeholder instructions. You can:

Option 1: Use the ICD signature logo you provided
- Download: https://customer-assets.emergentagent.com/job_carservice-manager/artifacts/9uvmesio_final%20sign%20white.png
- Resize to 192x192 and 512x512 pixels
- Place in /app/frontend/public/

Option 2: Create custom logo files with:
- ICD Tuning branding
- Red (#D32F2F) and black theme
- Transparent or solid background

Until these files are added, the PWA will use default icons.
